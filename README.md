Week 1:
Location of work : core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/programming-elements

• 16-Dec-2025 (Tuesday):
Installed Git and completed initial setup. Learned the basics of Git and GitHub, understood version control and repositories, and practiced basic Git commands such as git init, git status, git add, and git commit.
• 17-Dec-2025 (Wednesday):
Created a GitHub repository and connected the local project to a remote repository. Understood the concept of remote repositories and practiced important Git commands including git remote, git branch, git push, and git pull.
• 18-Dec-2025 (Thrusday):
Practiced Java Fundamentals and basic problem-solving questions. Solved programs related to variables, data types, arithmetic operations, unit conversions, profit and loss calculations, discounts, user input using Scanner, basic calculator operations, geometry-based problems, and logical problems such as maximum number of handshakes.

• 19-Dec-2025 (Friday):
Location of work : core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/control-flow
Studied Java Control Flow concepts and worked Practiced and implemented programs using the following concepts:
* Java Control Flow statements
* Boolean data type and boolean expressions
* Logical operators
* if, else if, and else conditional statements
* Loops (for and while)
* break and continue statements
* switch statement
Followed best programming practices, including:
* Declaring all values as variables (fixed values, user inputs, and results)
* Using proper program names and class names
* Maintaining correct indentation
* Adding comments for each logical block (variables, conditions, loops)
* Applying proper variable naming conventions

• 20-Dec-2025 (Saturday):
Location of work : core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/arrays
Studied Java Arrays and Multi-Dimensional Arrays. Practiced creating, accessing, modifying, and iterating arrays using loops and the length property. Solved Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 lab practice problems including employee bonus calculation, youngest and tallest among friends, largest and second-largest digit using arrays with dynamic resizing, reversing a number, BMI calculation using 1D and 2D arrays, student marks percentage and grade calculation, digit frequency, voting eligibility check, number analysis (positive, negative, even, odd), multiplication tables, sum of user-entered values, mean height calculation, odd and even number separation, factor finding with dynamic arrays, copying 2D array to 1D array, and FizzBuzz implementation.


Week 2:
• 22-Dec-2025 (Monday):
Location of work : core-java-practice/scenario-based
Scenario-Based Java Problem Solving
 Practiced real-world scenario-based Java problems using variables, primitive data types, Scanner for input, operators, conditional logic (if, else, switch), loops (for, while, do-while, for-each), and control flow statements (break, continue) while following clean coding practices. Solved scenarios including The Coffee Counter Chronicles and Maya’s BMI Fitness Tracker.

• 23-Dec-2025 (Tuesday): 
Location of work : core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/java-mathods
Completed submissions on Java Methods Lab Practices. Practiced user-defined methods, static methods, recursive methods, and standard library methods including Math class while following best programming practices. Solved method-based problems such as simple interest calculation, handshakes computation, triangular park running rounds, number classification, Spring Season check, sum of natural numbers (loop and recursion), smallest and largest of three numbers, quotient and remainder, chocolate distribution, wind chill calculation, trigonometric functions, factor analysis with sum, product and sum of squares, leap year validation, unit conversion utilities, student voting eligibility, youngest and tallest among friends, number comparison, BMI calculation using 2D arrays, quadratic equation roots, and random number analysis using Math functions.

• 24-Dec-2025 (Wednesday):
Location of work : core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/strings
 Studied Java String Lab Practices. Practiced creating and using strings, escape sequences, taking string input, string arrays, passing strings as method parameters, and working with String class built-in methods. Learned ASCII character codes and Java exception handling concepts including exception hierarchy, checked and unchecked exceptions. Followed best programming practices such as using variables for all values, implementing logic through methods instead of main(), proper naming conventions, and handling exceptions appropriately.

• 26-Dec-2025 (Friday): 
Location of work : OOPs/gcr-codebase
Practiced Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts including classes and objects, constructors, access modifiers, static vs non-static methods, types of methods, types of constructors, and types of variables. Also studied and implemented core OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and encapsulation through practice programs.
